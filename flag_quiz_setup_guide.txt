Step-by-Step Guide to Run Flag Quiz App

1. Set Up Your Project Folder:
   - Create a project folder for your flag quiz app (e.g., flag_quiz).

2. Install Python and Set Up a Virtual Environment:
   - If Python is not installed, download and install it from https://www.python.org/downloads/
   - During installation, make sure to check the box to "Add Python to PATH".
   - Open a terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell) and navigate to your project folder:
     cd C:\path\to\flag_quiz
   - Create a virtual environment:
     python -m venv venv
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
     On macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate

3. Install Required Dependencies:
   - With the virtual environment active, install Flask:
     pip install Flask
   - If you are using additional libraries (e.g., requests), install them using pip:
     pip install requests

4. Project Structure:
   Ensure the project folder has the following structure:
   flag_quiz/
     app.py          (Flask application)
     flags.py        (Flag data)
     venv/           (Virtual environment folder (automatically created))
     requirements.txt  (This will be created later)

5. Create the requirements.txt File:
   - To generate a requirements.txt file with your installed dependencies, run:
     pip freeze > requirements.txt

6. Running the Flask Application:
   - Make sure the virtual environment is activated.
   - Run the Flask app with:
     python app.py
   - Open a web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to see the flag quiz in action.

7. Stopping the Flask App:
   - To stop the Flask application, press CTRL+C in your terminal.

8. Deactivating the Virtual Environment:
   - When finished, deactivate the virtual environment by running:
     deactivate

9. Reinstalling Dependencies (for others):
   - If you or someone else wants to run your project on another machine, follow these steps:
     1. Clone or copy the project files.
     2. Create and activate the virtual environment.
     3. Install the required dependencies:
        pip install -r requirements.txt
     4. Run the Flask app with python app.py.

Summary of Commands:

Create and activate virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
.\venv\scripts\activate
source venv/bin/activate  (macOS/Linux)

Install Flask and other dependencies:
pip install Flask
pip install requests (if needed)

Freeze the installed packages into requirements.txt:
pip freeze > requirements.txt

Run the Flask app:
python app.py

Deactivate the virtual environment:
deactivate
